# joke-app-server

This is my FIRST ever app deployed to Heroku service! It serves data.json on request at a specified endpont.
I wrote it to parctice functionality express and axios packages. I also deployed another app (joke-app) that uses this one as a server providing the data (repo: https://github.com/mr-robak/joke-app).

To see it working go here (as long it will last ;):
